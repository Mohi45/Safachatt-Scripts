                <h2>What is Java?</h2>
                <p>Java is a <b>programming language</b> and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented
                    and
                    secure programming language.
                </p>
                <p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
                    James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a
                    registered company, James Gosling and his team changed the name from <b>Oak</b> to Java.</p>
                <p>
                    <mine>Java is 99% object-oriented. Primitive types like int,float, and
                        double make up the remaining 1%.
                    </mine>

                <h2>JRE, JDK & JVM</h2>
                <h3>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</h3>
                <p><b>Runtime Environment</b>. It is a package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java program,
                    including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, the java command, and other
                    infrastructure. However, it cannot be used to create new programs.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/basicImg/jre.png" alt="JRE Diagram">
                <h3>JDK (Java Development Kit)</h3>
                <p><b>Java Development Kit</b>, the full-featured SDK for Java. It has everything the JRE has, but also
                    the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is capable of creating and compiling
                    programs.</p>

            <!-- JVM Memory -->
            <section id="jvm-memory">
                <h2>JVM Memory Structure</h2>
                <h2>JVM Architecture</h2>
                <img src="../images/basicImg/jvm.png" alt="JVM Architecture">
                <h3>Heap Area</h3>
                <p>Heap stores the actual objects. It is created when the JVM starts up. The user can control the heap
                    if needed. It can be of fixed or dynamic size. When you use a new keyword, the JVM creates an
                    instance for the object in a heap. While the reference of that object stores in the stack. There
                    exists only one heap for each running JVM process. When the heap becomes full, the garbage is
                    collected. <b>(Garbage collection in heap areas is mandatory.)</b></p>
                <h3>For Example :: </h3>
                <example>Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);</example>
                <p><b>
                        The above statement creates the object of Scanner class which gets allocated to heap whereas the
                        reference ‘sc’ gets pushed to the stack
                    </b></p>

                <h3>Stack Area</h3>
                <p>Stack Area generates when a thread is created. It can be of either fixed or dynamic size. The stack
                    memory is allocated per thread. It is used to store data and partial results. It contains references
                    to heap objects. It also holds the value itself rather than a reference to an object from the heap.
                    The variables which are stored in the stack have certain visibility, called scope
                </p>
                <h3>Method Area</h3>
                <p>It is a logical part of the heap area and is created on virtual machine startup.
                    This memory is allocated for class structures, method data and constructor field data, and also for
                    interfaces or special methods used in class. Heap can be of fixed or dynamic size depending upon the
                    system’s configuration.
                </p>
                <h3>Native Stack</h3>
                <p>Also called as C stacks, native method stacks are not written in Java language. This memory is
                    allocated for each thread when it's created. And it can be of fixed or dynamic nature.
                </p>
                <h3>Program counter (PC) registers:</h3>
                <p>
                    Each JVM thread which carries out the task of a specific method has a program counter register
                    associated with it. The non native method has a PC which stores the address of the available JVM
                    instruction whereas in a native method, the value of the program counter is undefined. PC register
                    is capable of storing the return address or a native pointer on some specific platform.

            <!-- Garbage Collection -->
            <section id="garbage-collection">
                <h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
                <p>JVM triggers this process and as per the JVM garbage collection process is done or else withheld. It
                    reduces the burden of programmers by automatically performing the allocation or deallocation of
                    memory.
                    Note: <b>System.gc()</b> and <b>Runtime.gc()</b> are the methods which requests for Garbage
                    collection to JVM
                    explicitly but it doesn’t ensure garbage collection as the final decision of garbage collection is
                    of JVM only.

                <h3>🔍 Detailed Explanation (Every Point)</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>class</b><br>
                    <explain>A keyword in Java used to define a class.
                        A class is a blueprint that contains variables and methods.
                        Class name should start with a capital letter by convention.
                        The filename should be Simple.java.</explain><br>

                <p><b>👉 This line tells Java:</b> </p>
                <p>“Create a class named Simple.”</p>

                <mine>public static void main(String args[])</mine>

                <p>This is the most important line in any Java program.</p>

                <p><b>🔹 public</b> <br> An access modifier.

                    Makes the method accessible from anywhere.

                    Required so the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can call it.<br>

                    <b>🔹 static</b><br>

                    Means the method belongs to the class, not to an object.

                    JVM can call main() without creating an object.<br>

                    <b>🔹 void</b><br>

                    Return type of the method.

                    void means the method returns nothing.<br>

                    <b>🔹 main</b><br>

                    The entry point of the program.

                    Execution of a Java program always starts from main().<br>

                    <b>🔹 String args[]</b><br>

                    Used to accept command-line arguments.

                    String → data type

                    args → array name

                    [] → indicates an array
                </p>


                <mine>System.out.println("Hello Java");</mine>
                <p>
                    This line prints output to the screen. <br>

                    <b>🔹 System</b><br>

                    A predefined class in java.lang package.

                    Provides system-related resources.<br>

                    <b>🔹 out</b><br>

                    A static object of PrintStream.

                    Represents the standard output (screen/console).<br>

                    <b>🔹 println</b><br>

                    A method of PrintStream.

                    Prints the text and moves the cursor to a new line.<br>

                    <b>🔹 "Hello Java"</b><br>

                    A String literal (text).

                    Displayed as output.

                    An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.</p>
                <h3>assert Java Keyword</h3>
                <p>Assert describes a predicate (a true-false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the
                    developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false
                    at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optionally
                    enable by ClassLoader method.</p>
                <h3>boolean Java Keyword</h3>
                <p>Defines a boolean variable for the values "true" or "false" only. By default, the value of boolean
                    primitive type is false. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the
                    primitive type boolean.</p>

                <h3>break Keyword</h3>
                <p>The break keyword is used to prematurely exit a for, while, or do while loop or to mark the end of a
                    case block in a switch statement.</p>

                <h3>Java Keyword</h3>
                The byte keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
                This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type byte.

                <h3>case Java Keyword</h3>
                A statement in the switch block can be labeled with one or more case or default labels. The switch
                statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case
                label.

                <h3>catch Java Keyword</h3>
                Used in conjunction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch
                block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.

                <h3>char Java Keyword</h3>
                The char keyword is used to declare character variable.
                char is a Java primitive type.
                In Java, the data type used to store characters is char. The char data type is a single 16-bit
                Unicode character.
                It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
                The Wrapper Character class represents char primitive type as an object.
                <h3>class Java Keyword</h3>
                The class keyword is used to define the classes in Java. A class is a group of objects which have
                common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. In short, a class
                is the specification or template of an object.

                <h3>continue Java Keyword</h3>
                Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label,
                continue resumes execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

                The continue statement skips the current iteration of a for, while or do-while loop. The unlabeled
                form skips to the end of the innermost loop's body and evaluates the boolean expression that
                controls the loop.
                <h3>default Java Keyword</h3>
                The default keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to
                be executed if no case matches the specified value; see a switch. Alternatively, the default keyword
                can also be used to declare default values in a Java annotation. From Java 8 onwards, the default
                keyword is also used to specify that a method in an interface provides the default implementation of
                a method.

                <h3>do Java Keyword</h3>
                The do keyword is used in conjunction with while to create a do-while loop, which executes a block
                of statements associated with the loop and then tests a boolean expression associated with the
                while. If the expression evaluates to true, the block is executed again; this continues until the
                expression evaluates to false.

                <h3>double Java Keyword</h3>
                The double keyword is used to create a double primitive type.
                A double variable may store a double−precision floating point value. Double precision, as denoted by
                the double keyword, uses 64 bits to store a value.
                Double precision is actually faster than single precision on some modern processors that have been
                optimized for high-speed mathematical calculations.
                The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type double in an object. An object of type Double
                contains a single field whose type is double.
                <h3>else Java Keyword</h3>
                The Java if-else statement also tests the condition. It executes the if block if a condition is true
                otherwise else block, is executed.
                Syntex
                if(condition){
                statement 1; //code if condition is true
                }else{
                statement 2; //code if condition is false
                }
                <h3>enum Java Keyword</h3>
                An enum Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class Enum.

                public enum Day {
                SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
                THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY;
                }

                <h3>extends Java Keyword</h3>
                The extends keyword is used in a class or interface declaration to indicate that the class or
                interface being declared is a subclass of the class or interface whose name follows the extends
                keyword.

                <h3>final Java Keyword</h3>
                The final keyword in Java is used to restrict the user. The final keyword can be used with variable,
                method, and class.
                The final keyword may be applied to a variable, indicating the value of the final variable can not
                be changed (It will be constant).
                The final keyword may be applied to a class, indicating the class may not be extended (subclassed).
                The final keyword may be applied to a method, indicating the method may not be overridden in any
                subclass
                <h3>finally Java Keyword</h3>
                The finally used to define a block of statements for a block defined previously by the try keyword.
                The finally block is executed after execution exits the try block and any associated catch clauses
                regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught, or execution left method in the middle of
                the try or catch blocks using the return keyword.

                Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection,
                streametc.
                Java finally block is always executed whether an exception is handled or not.
                Java finally block follows try/catch block.
                For each try block, there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block.
                The finally block will not be executed if program exits(either by calling System.exit() or by
                causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort).
                <h3>float Java Keyword</h3>
                The float keyword is used to declare float primitive variable. A float variable may store a
                single−precision floating point value. The type float specifies a single-precision value that uses
                32 bits of storage. Single precision is faster on some processors and takes half as much space as
                double precision, but will become imprecise when the values are either very large or very small.

                <h3>for Java Keyword</h3>
                The for keyword is used to create a for loop, which specifies a variable initialization, a boolean
                expression, and an incrementation. The variable initialization is performed first, and then the
                boolean expression is evaluated. If the expression evaluates to true, the block of statements
                associated with the loop is executed, and then the incrementation is performed. The boolean
                expression is then evaluated again; this continues until the expression evaluates to false.
                <h3>if Java Keyword</h3>
                The if keyword is used to create an if statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the
                expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the if statement is executed.
                This keyword can also be used to create an if-else statement.

                <h3>implements Java Keyword</h3>
                The implements keyword is used in a class declaration to indicate that the class being declared
                provides implementations for all methods declared in the interface whose name follows the implements
                keyword.

                <h3>import Java Keyword</h3>
                The import keyword makes one class or all classes in a package visible in the current Java source
                file. Imported classes can be referenced without the use of fully−qualified class names.
                In simple words, if a class wants to use another class in the same package, the package name does
                not need to be used. Classes in the same package find each other.

                <h3>instanceof Java Keyword</h3>
                The Java instanceof keyword is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type
                (class or subclass or interface).
                Syntex:
                obj instanceOf Object
                The left side is the instance and right side is the Java class name. Java instanceof operator
                returns a boolean result.
                The instanceof in Java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance
                with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable
                that has a null value, it returns false.
                <h3>int Java Keyword</h3>
                The int keyword is used to declare a variable as a numeric type. For example, int a = 10;
                A int variable is a signed 32-bit type that has a range from –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
                The Integer class is a wrapper class for the int primitive type. It defines MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE
                constants representing the range of values for this type.
                <h3>interface Java Keyword</h3>
                Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract or default methods, constant
                (static final) fields and static interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the
                interface with the implements keyword. As multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, interfaces
                are used to circumvent it. An interface can be defined within another interface.

                <b>public interface Vehicle</b> {<br>
                String getBrand();<br>
                String speedUp();<br>
                String slowDown();<br>
                default String turnAlarmOn() {<br>
                return "Turning the vehice alarm on.";<br>
                }<br>
                default String turnAlarmOff() {<br>
                return "Turning the vehicle alarm off.";<br>
                }<br>
                static int getHorsePower(int rpm, int torque) {<br>
                return (rpm * torque) / 5252;<br>
                }<br>
                }

                <h3>long Java Keyword</h3>
                The long keyword is used to declare a variable as a long primitive type.
                The long primitive type is a signed 64-bit type and is useful for those occasions where an int type
                is not large enough to hold the desired value.
                The Long class is a wrapper class for the long primitive type. It defines MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE
                constants representing the range of values for this type.
                <h3>native Java Keyword</h3>
                The native keyword may be applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in a
                language other than Java.
                The native keyword is used to declare a method which is implemented in platform-dependent code such
                as C or C++. When a method is marked as native, it cannot have a body and must ends with a semicolon
                instead.
                The Java Native Interface (JNI) specification governs rules and guidelines for implementing native
                methods, such as data type conversion between Java and the native application.
                <h3>new Java Keyword</h3>
                <p>The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a class.<br>
                    <b> new Java Keyword Examples</b><br>
                    The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a class.<br>
                    Student student = new Student("Tom", 20);<br>
                    The new keyword can be used to create a new array object:<br>
                    // use the new keyword to create an int array object<br>
                    int[] intArray = new int[10];<br>
                    The new keyword can be used to create a new String array object:<br>
                    // use the new keyword to create a String object<br>
                    String string = new String();
                </p>

                <h3>package Java Keyword</h3>
                Java package is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the package
                keyword.

                For example:

                package java.lang;
                package java.util;
                <h3>private Java Keyword</h3>
                The private keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; private members
                can only be accessed by other members of their own class
                <h3>protected Java Keyword</h3>
                The protected keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; protected
                members can only be accessed by members of their own class, that class's subclasses or classes from
                the same package
                <h3> public Java Keyword</h3>
                The public keyword is an access control modifier that may be applied to a class, a method or a field
                (a variable declared in a class).
                If a class or its members are declared as public, they can be accessed from any other class
                regardless of the package boundary. It is comparable to a public place in the real world, such as a
                company cafeteria that all employees can use irrespective of their department.
                <h3>return Java Keyword</h3>
                The return keyword causes a method to return to the method that called it, passing a value that
                matches the return type of the returning method.
                <h3>short Java Keyword</h3>
                The short keyword is used to declare a variable as a numeric type.
                short is a signed 16-bit type.
                It has a range from –32,768 to 32,767.
                The Short class is a wrapper class for the short primitive type. It defines MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE
                constants representing the range of values for this type.
                <h3>static Java Keyword</h3>
                The static keyword is used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes
                maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. static also
                is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of to a
                specific instance, and can only operate on class fields.

                <h3>strictfp Java Keyword</h3>
                strictfp is a keyword in the Java programming language that restricts floating-point calculations to
                ensure portability.

                <h3>super Java Keyword</h3>
                The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class object.
                The super has two general forms:
                The first calls the superclass constructor.
                The second is used to access methods or instance variables of the superclass that has been hidden by
                a member of a subclass.
                <h3>switch Java Keyword</h3>
                The switch statement is Java’s multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch
                execution to different parts of your code based on the value of an expression. As such, it often
                provides a better alternative than a large series of if-else-if statements.
                synchronized Java Keyword
                Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the
                current thread executes the code.

                We can synchronize our code in either of two ways. Both involve the use of the synchronized keyword.
                Using Synchronized Methods
                Using Synchronized Statement Or Block
                <h3>this Java Keyword</h3>
                In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.</p>

                <h2>throw vs throws</h2>
                <p><b>throw:</b> Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue
                    with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the catch keyword to handle an assignment
                    compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the
                    method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found
                    in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught exception
                    handler.</p>
                <p><b>throws:</b> The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives information to the
                    programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer to provide the
                    exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.
                </p>

                <p>
                    throws bolta hai: <br>
                    Is method me exception aa sakta hai, caller sambhale
                    <b>readFile():</b> exception handle nahi karta

                <h2>Control Statement </h2>
                <p>
                    Control statements are used to control the order of execution of statements in a program.
                    Normally, Java executes code line by line (top to bottom), but control statements allow us to:<br>
                    👉make decisions<br>
                    👉repeat code<br>
                    👉jump to different parts of the program

                <p>An array is a collection of similar type elements stored in continuous memory locations under a
                    single name.
                    Each element is accessed using an index number.</p>
                <example>int[] a = {10, 20, 30};</example>

                <p>
                    <b>1.</b> Array stores multiple values in a single variable.<br>

                    <b>2.</b> All elements must be of same datatype.<br>

                    <b>3.</b> Array uses indexing (index starts from 0).<br>

                    <b>4.</b> Array size is fixed once declared.<br>

                    <b>5.</b> Arrays provide fast access to elements.<br>

                    <b>6.</b> Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.<br>

                    <b>7.</b> Arrays are treated as objects in Java.<br>
